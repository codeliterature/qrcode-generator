# qrcode-generator
Qr Code Generator Magitech addition. Our very first project where we use Node</br>
Qr Code generator is a simple web application that uses express, body-parser and qrimage module to create a simple qr code.</br>
We used simple Ejs file for structuring, and minimal CSS for designing.</br>
By default the pulic directory houses no images, and is instead occupied by a new image generated, after which every subsequent file replaces the older file.</br>
A function is set to delete the image from server under the specific time, so that no bug remains.</br>
As our very first project where we use backend.</br>
